# Microsoft Power BI - The Complete MasterClass Study Notes

## Summary

After finishing the course on Microsoft Fabric DP-600 by Nikolai Schuler, I decided that it was time to push on to Power BI. This will act as my repository for my jupyter notebook course notes. I am using this as a supplement to my DataQuest journey so that my Data Visualization skills improve using a Microsoft platform foundation.
